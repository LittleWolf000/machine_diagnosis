Seeing is Believing
There is an old saying that what you hear about may be false, what you see is true. It is a good habit to listen to other people. But we should believe what we see. That is the topic of "Seeing is Believing".
Transportation sometimes makes mistakes. The society is like a network. We get information from our friend, family or college. We trust them. But it doesn't mean that the information is right. They may misunderstand the information and tell us what they think is right. For example, my mom told me that it would rain tomorrow. But when I looked for the weather forecast, it's wrong, not the weather, but the area. So when you want to get the truth, you need to figure it out. To see is to believe.
It is not true because most people agree to it. According to the statistics, the higher the frequency, the greater the probability. but probability is not equal to the truth. The story that Bruno devoted his life to the truth can support it. The view of the geocentric theory was deeply rooted in the first half of last century. Due to the lack of the technology, most of people think Earth is the center of the universe. Modern people with spaceship and astronomical telescope treat it as ignorance. Earth is not the center of the univer, even the solar system. Don't follow others blindly.
What is it behind the mountain? It is the mountain, but only the people who have been there can say it. When we pursure the truth, We should accept the suggestions of others humbly, but we must also keep our own independent thinking, and don't follow the crowd.
